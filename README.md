### Core Workflows

#### 1. Data Collection

1. Navigate to the **Admin** section
2. Click "Launch Collection App" to start the data collection interface
3. Students can access the collection interface to record their videos
4. Videos are automatically processed and faces extracted

#### 2. Gallery Creation

1. Go to **Create Galleries** section
2. Select the department and batch year
3. Choose the directory containing processed videos
4. Configure augmentation settings if needed
5. Click "Create Gallery" to generate the face recognition gallery

#### 3. Face Recognition

1. Navigate to **Recognition** section
2. Select one or more galleries to search against
3. Upload an image containing faces
4. View recognition results with similarity scores

#### 4. Gallery Management

1. Visit **Galleries** section to view all created galleries
2. Check gallery statistics and student counts
3. Delete or update galleries as needed

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

- `MODEL_PATH` - Path to LightCNN model weights
- `YOLO_PATH` - Path to YOLO model weights
- `DATA_DIR` - Directory for storing processed data
- `GALLERY_DIR` - Directory for storing gallery files

#### Database Configuration

The application uses SQLite by default. Database file is located at `data/app.db`.

## Performance Optimization

### GPU Acceleration

- CUDA support for faster face detection and recognition
- Automatic device selection (CUDA/CPU)
- Batch processing for improved throughput

### Image Augmentation

- Configurable augmentation ratio (0.0 to 1.0)
- Multiple augmentation techniques:
  - Resolution scaling
  - Brightness/contrast adjustment
  - Gaussian blur
  - Combined transformations

### Database Optimization

- Indexed queries for fast gallery lookups
- Efficient metadata storage
- Gallery registration tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**

   - Check if another instance is running
   - Use different port in configuration
2. **Model weights not found**

   - Ensure model files are in correct directories
   - Check file permissions
3. **CUDA out of memory**

   - Reduce batch size
   - Use CPU mode instead
4. **Video processing fails**

   - Verify FFmpeg installation
   - Check video file format support

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting environment variable:

```bash
export DEBUG=1
python src/main.py
